  # The price of wider gaps and weaker links

  ## As Central Texas’ economy booms, its racial divides have only become more acute and costly

  <p class="author">By Dan Zehr / Published January 18, 2015</p>

  {{> infobox page.infobox1}}

  Natalie Madeira Cofield spent 12 years working in Los Angeles, New York and Washington. She knows what it’s like to live in a city with a large and vibrant African-American community.

  When Cofield moved to Austin in August 2011 — just 29 years old at the time — she became one of the youngest CEOs of any black chamber of commerce in the country. She understands what it’s like to be a successful, young professional in a booming Central Texas economy.

  But here in Austin, a city that takes pride in its reputation as a progressive and inclusive community, Cofield also knows that these two facets of her personal and professional lives don’t often overlap.

  “There’s no one place you can say: ‘There’s a black community center,’” said Cofield, head of the Greater Austin Black Chamber of Commerce.

  “The preserved legacy of the African-American community has not been completely forgotten as change happens,” she said, but the region’s torrential growth has swept away much of it.

  Cofield still exudes an optimistic view of Austin’s future and the role black residents and businesses will play in shaping what’s to come. But many local African-American community leaders say the city’s progressive credentials fail when it comes to its tentative embrace of black history and culture.

  In fact, emerging research indicates the economic rifts between Austin’s minority and majority populations have widened as the metro area has grown — a threat not only to its forward-thinking reputation, but to its overall economic potential.

  Metro areas with higher levels of racial and income integration tend to see their young residents climb higher up the income ladder than more-segregated cities, according to a study by Harvard University economist Raj Chetty and his colleagues with the Equality of Opportunity Project.
  By one of their key measures, Austin’s upward mobility rate trailed all but three Texas metro areas — Dallas, Killeen and Waco — and it lagged well behind the tech-savvy hubs in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Portland, Ore.
  A separate analysis found that the level of income segregation in Central Texas ranks among the highest of any metro area in the country. And just a cursory glance at a racial dispersion map of the Central Texas population reveals just how divided the region remains today.

  A recent study by PolicyLink, a California-based research and advocacy nonprofit, said the Austin-area economy would’ve been $21.7 billion larger in 2012 — a 22 percent increase — if its minority populations enjoyed the same employment and wage distributions as its Anglo majority.

  The region’s racial divides have become increasingly acute for its African-American population, which struggles with higher poverty rates, more-isolated neighborhoods and lower education and employment levels. Yet, Central Texas has done little to prioritize and narrow these widening gaps, community leaders said.

  As a result, many of the social institutions that long anchored the African-American community have been diminished or destroyed entirely, leaders and researchers said.

  Gone are many of the schools, businesses and neighborhoods where affluent black professionals moving into the region could connect with the existing, often disadvantaged African-American population. And because these types of cultural mainstays also enrich a community in ways that extend across racial lines, their loss has also weakened the ties between Austin’s African-American minority and its Anglo majority, leaders said.

  “Austin is quickly becoming a city of the privileged and the nonprivileged,” said the Rev. Freddie Dixon, who for 22 years served as pastor at Wesley United Methodist Church, one of the city’s oldest historically black churches. “Is that the kind of Austin we want?”

  ###Bigger city, fewer minorities

  Cynthia Cobbs didn’t like the kind of Austin she was seeing in the late 1990s. At the time, she and her family were renting a place near Rundberg Lane — “back when it was starting to get bad,” she said.

  They had wanted to buy a house for years but couldn’t afford a home in Austin that was big enough for the family’s three kids. So, despite the rising rates of crime and poverty in the neighborhood, they put their search on hold.

  {{> photo-right page.photoCobbs}}

  It reignited one day in 1997, when their oldest daughter announced she wanted to attend a different school. She didn’t say where, Cobbs said; she just wanted out of Dobie Middle School.

  They looked around Austin for a while before, on the advice of their real estate agent, turning to Pflugerville. For $123,000, they had a new a home with four bedrooms and two bathrooms on a quiet, diverse street.

  “Pflugerville was culture shock for her,” Cobbs said of her daughter’s adjustment to a school and community that didn’t yet have a large African-American population. “Dobie was mostly black and Hispanic. Pflugerville had black students out there; you saw them out there, but if you went into the classroom there would be one or two.”

  Plenty has changed since then. Cobbs’ daughter went on to graduate from Pflugerville High School and later got her master’s degree. Meanwhile, the exodus of African-American residents from Austin to the suburbs has sent Pflugerville’s black population soaring.

  The number of African-American residents in Pflugerville jumped almost fivefold from 2000 to 2012, growing to 15.3 percent of the town’s population from 9.8 percent, according to census data.

  The number of African-Americans within the Austin city limits has moved the other way. While the overall city population ballooned by 20.4 percent from 2000 to 2010, the number of black residents actually declined by 5.4 percent, a loss of 3,500 people, according to census data.

  Austin, once considered a safe haven for freed slaves, has become the only one of the country’s 10-fastest growing cities to see its African-American population decline during that decade, said Eric Tang, a University of Texas professor in the African and African Diaspora Studies Department.

  And while the metro area as a whole gained black residents over that span, the African-American share of the total Central Texas population continued its decades-long decline.

  The portions of the city that have lost population in recent years tend to have higher poverty rates than the many growing areas, Tang said. But Austin’s losses weren’t necessarily a factor of middle-class flight. The tracts that lost African-Americans actually saw poverty rates decrease among the remaining minority residents, he said.

  “Those who left were taking their poverty with them,” he said.

  In fact, suburban poverty grew faster in the Austin area than in any other U.S. metro area from 2000 to 2011, according to a 2012 Brookings Institution report. Gentrification and rising property taxes have pushed many of the city’s low-income and minority residents farther from downtown, making poverty an increasingly regional issue and shifting a growing public welfare burden on outlying towns with fewer resources to address it.

  The increasingly sharp level of income segregation, while not unusual for a growing metro area, is higher in Austin than in all but eight of the country’s 100 largest metro areas — a potential contributing factor to the region’s mediocre rates of economic mobility.

  Of the three dozen factors Chetty and his colleagues measured for their impact on economic mobility rates, Austin’s sharpest deficiencies arose in education and segregation, both racial and economic.

  The region’s pockets of concentrated poverty — almost all in minority neighborhoods east of Interstate 35 — are losing access to economic opportunities as the separation between income levels increases.

  Yet addressing the area’s racial and cultural divides might produce the greater payoff in terms of economic mobility. While these forces are toughest to pin down, researchers said, they’re often the most important to consider because they coincide so closely with many of the other factors that inhibit opportunity.

  As such, attacking the disadvantages that correlate with race would address a range of other economic barriers as well, researchers say.

  “The great thing about that is that it’s just unambiguously a good thing,” Chetty said before delivering an address at the University of Texas last year. “If we can figure out how to get more upward mobility, that’s both reducing inequality — giving opportunities to disadvantaged kids — and just raising GDP.”

  ###‘Lack of opportunities’

  If Austin’s demographic trends are any indication, many of the city’s African-American parents don’t believe those opportunities exist here.

  Cobbs didn’t think so when she moved her family to Pflugerville. Now single and with her kids off on their own, she moved back to Austin again. She works as a stylist at HCS Salon and Spa in East Austin and rents her sister’s condo in the Coronado Hills area.

  She’s not alone among working-age African-Americans in the city. The number of black residents at least 18 years old actually increased from 2000 to 2010 in Austin, despite the overall decline that decade, according to an analysis by city demographer Ryan Robinson. Like Cobbs did in 1997, parents moving their kids out of the city accounted for virtually all the black-population loss from 2000 to 2010.

  “Because of the overall lack of opportunities in the city,” said Tang, the UT professor, “their children and grandchildren don’t see Austin as a viable place to build stable middle-class careers.”

  Their departures, coupled with an influx of well-educated black professionals into Austin’s high-tech and creative job market, helped create two separate bands in the African-American population.

  Cofield recognized that trend because she also saw it during her time in Washington. The existing African-American community doesn’t mesh with new arrivals who come for higher-skill, higher-wage jobs.

  “That’s not to say one can’t go from a historical community and move into the educated stratum,” Cofield said. “They’re not mutually exclusive, but there’s not always a connection between them.”

  {{> photo-right page.photoMcghee}}

 A large black population and a vibrant African-American culture can help bridge that divide in cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Washington. But in Central Texas, the smaller black population lacks the sheer numbers that can overcome the lost connections.

  Meanwhile, Austin’s booming development diminished or swept away many of the shared cultural institutions that might otherwise narrow those gaps. Absent any concerted, communitywide push to the contrary, efforts to preserve the region’s African-American culture and history could keep losing ground, especially as the urban core gentrifies.

  Rosewood Courts has become the latest strike point for these forces, as well as the city’s efforts to counteract them. As one of the nation’s oldest public housing projects — it was built in the late 1930s atop Emancipation Park, itself an African-American landmark in the city — Rosewood has come to hold a key historical significance in the mind of many East Austin residents.

  Most people agree on the need to upgrade the buildings, which don’t have central air conditioning, for example. Officials at the Housing Authority of the City of Austin imagine a project that would preserve and renovate five or six buildings — up to a quarter of the current 124 units there — while razing and rebuilding the rest.

  Many Rosewood residents and community activists see the city’s plan as a long-overdue sign of progress, one that will bring more low-income housing into the 21st century. Yet, many others compare the city’s current approach to post-Katrina New Orleans, where many historically African-American neighborhoods were demolished and uprooted as part of the hurricane recovery process.

  “There’s still a sense of community here,” said Eleanor Perkins, a resident who went from door to door with a petition to preserve the complex.

  Perkins said she was surprised to see the diversity in her Rosewood neighbors, with more people from Africa and South Asia than she expected. But most felt comfortable there because it fit their means and their lives, she said.

  “For me, everything is so comfortable in my senior years,” she said. “I’m just holding fast to Rosewood.”

  ###Lost cultural identity

  The fight over Rosewood’s history and future reflects an irony of integration and development: The concentration within a segregated neighborhood can spark a powerful community spirit. But as civil rights advances started dismantling an official framework of segregation, the local energy and activity in East Austin started to seep out.

  In the minds of many African-American leaders and longtime residents, the closure of L.C. Anderson High School was the crippling blow.

  {{> photo-right page.photoRosewood}}

  L.C. Anderson served as a communal bond for many in East Austin’s African-American community. Residents took a special pride in the football championships, the academic achievements and the classrooms as a coalescing force for both African-American students and the community at large.

  A federal judge ordered the closure of the old L.C. Anderson in 1971 as part of a desegregation ruling. And while a new, integrated L.C. Anderson High School opened two years later, it held little in common with its predecessor.

  The new Anderson opened northwest of downtown, more than 10 miles from the original. The black and yellow colors of the Yellow Jackets were replaced by the blue and gold of the Trojans. The few references to Yellow Jacket championship teams appear only in a pair of yearbooks from the 1960s.

  “Once we dissolved that school, the pride, the breakup of the consensus and concentric-ness of the community here just dissipated,” Dixon said. “This community has never gotten over the demolition of the high school.”

  The same fading energy beset the African-American business community, said Tommy Wyatt, publisher of The Villager, a weekly newspaper in East Austin.

  When Wyatt moved to Austin in 1962, he could go to Scarborough’s department store downtown, but — because he was black — he couldn’t try on a hat before buying it.

  “If it touched your head,” he said, “you bought it whether you liked it or not.”

  So, like communities throughout the country, African-American residents developed their own thriving communities of stores, professionals and services. A walk down San Bernard Street in the early 1960s would lead past the homes and offices of all manner of black professionals — a doctor’s office here, a college professor’s home there, a law firm next door.

  In a sense, Wyatt said, it was the pinnacle of Austin’s African-American business community.

  “This was the place to be,” he said. “A lot of cities in Texas envied us because of the kind of community we were.”

  Dixon hoped to rekindle some of that community pride through a magnet program at a new Kealing Middle School.

  Like the old Anderson High School, Kealing Junior High closed after the 1971 desegregation ruling. A new Kealing had opened in 1986 with a traditional program for neighborhood students and the magnet program Dixon had envisioned for seventh- and eighth-graders from across the Austin school district. (It added a sixth-grade program in 2004.)

  Today, African-American students compose 37.5 percent of the non-magnet student body but just 1.1 percent of the magnet school’s enrollment, according to district data. Dixon calls the low number of black students in the magnet program “my greatest lament.”

  “Diversity is good, the transition and moving out,” he said, “but we’ve lost all semblances of cultural identity.”

  ###‘I’m an ancestor’

  A growing network of African-American business leaders, community activists and artists is working to rebuild some of that lost cultural identity. And to do so, many of them are tapping into Austin’s prevailing economic and cultural momentum.

  Cofield and her colleagues at the chamber, for example, launched the “I Am Black Austin” campaign, which showcases successful African-American residents who embody the region’s broader entrepreneurial and creative spirit.

  “It’s not about having all these separate events that communicate the black community is valued,” Cofield said. “It’s also showing that the black community is integral to things that aren’t uniquely African-American in Austin.”

  Such efforts from the African-American community alone won’t close the region’s racial divides, Cofield and other community leaders said. If Central Texas hopes to uphold its progressive reputation and realize its fullest economic potential, they said, the entire community must work proactively to combat the divided status quo.

  But African-American leaders aren’t sitting around and waiting for a collective effort to unfold. They’re launching tech startups, forming bands and founding dance studios, like China Smith did with Ballet Afrique.

  Smith says Austin is in the early stages of a black renaissance — what her friends Qi Dada and Chaka Mpeanaji, the husband-and-wife duo who front hip-hop band Riders Against the Storm, have called a “cultural explosion.”

  That optimism helps drives her work at Ballet Afrique, the dance studio and company she founded in 2008. But she also tempers her hopes with the skepticism of someone who grew up with the peculiar and pervasive racial divides that exist in Central Texas.

  In many ways, Smith said, she was raised within a progressive Austin stereotype. Her father, a transplant from Berkeley, Calif., gravitated toward a diverse group of friends and encouraged the same for her.

  Yet, despite the seemingly open environment around her, she was regularly reminded — in ways subtle and not-so-subtle — that she was the different one, the other. At a party during junior high, she said, one boy introduced her to another, saying: “See, I told you she was pretty for a black girl.”

  So Smith immersed herself in an expression of beauty that no one could sully: dance. She studied at UT, learned a variety of African-American styles while travelling through the Caribbean and trained with the renowned Alvin Ailey troupe — all before returning to Central Texas to open Ballet Afrique.

  When she first left, she wanted to get as far away from Austin as possible. The lure of home drew her back, but she can still feel the sting of that introduction in junior high, of the summer camp magician who called her out as the only black child in the audience, of the myriad other slights over the years.

  Smith said Ballet Afrique was her one best chance to give her young son, daughter and students a different Austin experience — her opportunity to create an environment where children could take pride in their African-American heritage and blend it with the best elements of Austin’s creative and inclusive culture.

  “I’m an ancestor to these kids,” she said. “I have to have an optimistic view because if I don’t, what does that mean for the next generation who grow up here?”
