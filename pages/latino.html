      # Different divides from different sources
      ## Subhead need here
      
      Austin’s history of public discrimination reflects many of the same patterns seen throughout the South and the rest of the country.

      However, the influx of Latino residents that gained momentum throughout the 20th century spawned alternative forms of discrimination throughout Texas.

      In Austin, it wasn’t always that way, according to a 1979 report for the city’s Human Relations Committee.

      The report’s demographic breakdowns showed a small, extremely poor Hispanic population in 1880, with African-Americans in far greater numbers and more dispersed throughout the city limits.

      It wasn’t until the early- to mid-1900s that Austin’s Hispanic population started to boom and rivaled the size of its black community. At the time, Mexican-American families started to concentrate in East Austin and to the south, often replacing low-income Anglo residents.

      By mid-century, the Hispanic population had overtaken that of African-Americans and spread throughout more parts of the city.

      To deal with this growing population, Texas and its cities developed a new, “tri-racial” form of segregation, said Eliot Tretter, a UT lecturer who chronicled Austin’s past and current divides in his report, “Austin Restricted.”

      While state regulations and court rulings often classified Hispanic residents as white, Tretter said, a clear separation remained between Mexican immigrants and the state’s Anglo population.

      Tretter didn’t uncover any court cases that conclusively proved an official, public segregation of Hispanics. However, he said, as the Latino population in Austin started to boom, the language in many private covenants and deed restrictions shifted from “no people of African descent” to “Caucasian only.”

      The fact that such exclusionary language had become a standard practice in private deals only reinforced the growing divisions in Austin, Tretter said.

      For example, the concerns that racial integration would lead to unstable communities not only shaped the criteria for government loans, they became a more-localized default for denying a private loans and purchases as well.

      Today, the geographical divides between Austin’s Hispanic and Anglo communities bear out the impact of those public policies and private restrictions. Current demographics maps show the metro area’s Latino neighborhoods overwhelmingly to the East and South.

      Compared with Austin’s African-American community, the region’s larger Hispanic population and the broader diffusion of a Tex-Mex culture has helped forge a closer integration between the Latino minority and Anglo majority here.

      Yet, despite facing different histories of discrimination, Austin’s African-American and Hispanic communities still face many of the same divides in wealth, education, income and neighborhood proximity. Today, they still face a divided Austin.
