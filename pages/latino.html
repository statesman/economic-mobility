  # How Austin isolated Latinos with a unique form of segregation

  ## Though the sources of the divides differ, the lasting effects of discrimination on both the city’s African-American and Latino residents are similarly detrimental

  Austin’s history of public discrimination reflects many of the same patterns seen throughout the South and the rest of the country.

  However, the past century’s influx of Latino residents spawned alternative forms of discrimination across much of Texas.

  In Austin, it wasn’t always that way, according to a 1979 study for the city’s Human Relations Committee.

  The report’s demographic breakdowns showed a small, extremely poor Hispanic population in 1880, with African-Americans in greater numbers and more dispersed throughout the city limits.

  It wasn’t until the middle of the 20th century that Austin’s Hispanic population started to boom and rival the size of its black community. As that migration progressed, Mexican-American families started to concentrate in East Austin and to the south, often replacing low-income Anglo residents.

  By mid-century, the Hispanic population had surpassed that of African-Americans and was spread throughout more parts of the city.

  In response to their growing Latino populations, Austin and other Texas cities started developing a new “tri-racial” form of segregation, said Eliot Tretter, a University of Texas lecturer who chronicled Austin’s past and current divides in his report, “Austin Restricted.”

  While state regulations and court rulings often classified Hispanic residents as white, Tretter said, a clear separation remained between Mexican immigrants and the state’s Anglo population.

  No court cases conclusively proved an official, public segregation of Hispanics, he found, but the discriminatory language in private covenants and deed restrictions shifted from “no people of African descent” to “Caucasian only” — a phrase that would segregate against Hispanic and African-American alike.

  The fact that such exclusionary language had become a standard practice in private deals only reinforced the growing divisions in Austin, Tretter said. For example, worries that integration would destabilize communities shaped the criteria for government loans, and that trickled down to become a local default for the denial of private loans and purchases.

  The results of Austin’s history of public and private segregation reveal themselves on current demographic maps, which show the metro area’s minority neighborhoods remain concentrated to the east and south of the city.
  Like most of the area’s African-American residents, its Latino residents experience significant gaps in wealth, education, income and neighborhood proximity.
