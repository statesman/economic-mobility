  Vonnye Rice-Gardner’s parents didn’t have many options when they wanted to buy their first house.

  It was the early 1930s, and just a few years earlier the Austin City Council demarcated a new “negro district” in the eastern part of the city. If Friendly and Johnnie Mae Yates Rice wanted access to public schools and other city services, they had but one neighborhood to choose from.

  So, with $500 borrowed from their parents, they purchased a $1,200 house near the corner of East Seventh and Comal streets, within the new district.

  {{> infobox page.infobox1}}

  Rice-Gardner lives in that same house today — “I’m one of the few people whose driver’s license and birth certificate have the same address,” she says with a laugh — but few other signs of the area’s African-American heritage remain.

  When she was growing up, five or six black families lived on her block of East Seventh alone. Now, she has just one African-American neighbor on the block, and her cozy, one-story white house is one of the few non-commercial structures left on this primary corridor through East Austin.

  The mere fact that Rice-Gardner’s parents purchased a home at all, despite the segregation of the day, was as important as it was unusual. That nest egg—supplemented by the priority her parents put on education—helped her accrue the means to remain in that same house even as the neighborhood gentrified and so many of her neighbors moved.

  As Rice-Gardner can attest, home ownership has served as one of the most-effective vehicles for wealth creation in the nation’s history. But past decades of public policy and private practice barred most of the country’s African-American residents from purchasing a home at all.

  Central Texas was no exception. The roots of the Austin metro area’s current racial and income segregation, as well as the host of social issues that go hand-in-hand with such isolation, can be drawn from its history of housing discrimination.

  Even in subsequent decades as those official regulations were rescinded, discriminatory restrictions infiltrated the private sector—ultimately morphing into more-neutral public policies and private practices that do more to sustain a divided status quo than combat it.

  This is not merely a legacy of the past. While historical limitations on African-American home ownership barred them from the wealth created and accrued through home equity, predatory lending practices during the recent recession forced a disproportionate number of black residents out of ownership entirely, according to Rice University sociologist Gregory Sharp.

  That continued inertia has helped amplify Austin’s wealth disparities over subsequent generations, to a point where economic research suggests the rifts could threaten the entire region’s future economic prosperity.

  For example, the metro area now has one of the nation’s highest levels of income segregation, a factor that shares a strong correlation with lower rates of intergenerational economic mobility in a community, according to research led by Harvard University economist Raj Chetty.

  The advantages gained by the white majority and the disadvantages visited on the African-American minority in the past have only accumulated through the generations.

  “A lot of the policies that created our current situation are often forgotten and overlooked,” said Jennifer Jellison Holme, an educational policy and planning professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “Then, as a society, we look at the distribution of wealth and student achievement and start to make assumptions about people’s aptitude and merit without understanding all the historical practices and policies that shaped who won and lost.”

  ### A divided history

  Like the rest of the country, the roots of Austin’s racial divides stretch back into slavery and beyond, but the city didn’t always follow the typical path through Reconstruction.

  As thousands of freed slaves migrated toward cities in the post-Civil War years, Austin came to be known as safe haven for freed slaves, a more-tolerant city with less of the racial violence that would burn throughout the South for the better part of the next century.

  Private restrictions and municipal zoning policies still limited where this influx of black residents could settle — confining them primarily to Clarksville, Wheatville [sic] and other neighborhoods — but those pockets were dispersed throughout the city limits. In fact, a series of Austin demographic maps suggests a more racially interspersed population in 1880 and 1910 than in any time since.

  During those years, though, city leaders and developers set about consolidating the city’s black population and formalizing segregation, led in part by Monroe Shipe, a colonel who moved to Austin from Kansas and helped develop Hyde Park.

  This new neighborhood established a racially separated precedent for development in the city, according to a history of Austin’s housing segregation compiled by UT lecturer Eliot Tretter. Ads touted Hyde Park as “free from nuisances and an objectionable class of people, proper restrictions being taken to guard against undesirable occupants.”

  However, Shipe and other developers lost their biggest discriminatory tool in 1917, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities could not use zoning laws to segregate by race. They started looking for alternative policies to uphold segregation. The most-effective one arrived in 1928, in the form of a new city plan authored by the Dallas consulting firm Koch and Fowler.

  “Koch and Fowler came in and said, ‘Let’s get a little creative,’” Jellison Holme said. “Instead of saying you can’t live there, they segregated services — ‘You can choose to live there, but you‘re not going to get access to city utilities and services.’”

  {{> blockquote page.quoteHolme1}}

  Their plan laid out a “negro district” and, by barring public services outside of it, the city essentially created one viable neighborhood option for its African-American residents. Like Rice-Gardner’s parents in the early 1930s, the vast majority of the city’s black population consolidated in the district in the decades thereafter.

  The federal government would cement that separation less than a decade later.

  As part of a New Deal policy to rebuild wealth during the Depression, the government started backing low-cost mortgages and refinance loans to promote and preserve home ownership. The plan jump-started one of the largest accumulations of citizen wealth in the nation’s history, an effort that not only rebuilt wealth at the time but laid the foundation for decades of benefits that accrue through generations of home owners.

  However, the same policies excluded most minority neighborhoods through a practice known as redlining, which marked communities where the government-backed loans could not be offered. As most Americans gained equity in new homes or upgraded the value of their existing houses, the black population saw a racial wedge driven deeper between Anglo affluence and African-American poverty.

  The Koch and Fowler “negro district” became the largest redlined zone in Austin.

  Rice-Gardner knew the personal fallout of that redlined segregation all too well. Her father, Friendly Rice, was the principal at Blackshear and a pioneer in Austin education, so he insisted she go to the best school in the city.

  For ninth grade he had her enrolled at University Junior High, the majority white and more academically rigorous middle school. To get to there, though, she had to take two buses across town.

  The East End bus would wait for the junior high students before heading across on Sixth Street and dropping them off at the school. But, knowing where she was headed, one of the route’s drivers refused to let her board.

  So Rice-Gardner had two options: leave 30 minutes earlier to avoid him, or hope there were enough of the right people from the black community to convince the driver otherwise.

  She started leaving a half hour earlier.

  ### Compounding effects of segregation

  The discrimination didn’t end at the school door. Shortly after starting at University Junior High, one teacher pulled the handful of black ninth-graders aside and urged them to transfer back to Kealing, the majority black junior high in East Austin.

  None of them filled out the transfer forms. Rice-Gardner didn’t even mention it to her parents.

  “The first thing she said was, ‘You’ll never make it in the white world. I don’t want you all to be disappointed. I don’t want you to be hurt,’” she said. “And I truly believe she meant that.”

  Yet in many ways, Rice-Gardner and her classmates were the exception to the rule for African-American students. Her father and mother, both educators, had enough influence to make sure she got a top-notch education and enough affluence to give the family a stable home environment.

  Many black families didn’t have those advantages. For them, the far-reaching effects rippled out from housing segregation and into myriad indirect but no less insidious forms of discrimination, which then passed through the generations.

  “The thing about housing segregation,” said Andrew Valls, a political science professor at Oregon State University, “is that once it’s created, it’s very difficult to dismantle.”

  Schools and other social institutions tend to be more easily integrated because people come and go, Valls said. Housing segregation has more-enduring effects.

  In Austin, housing segregation has calcified into what demographic maps still show today — a higher-income, better-educated Anglo majority west of Interstate 35, and a lower-income, Hispanic and African-American population residing primarily east of the interstate.

  And like the housing-based wealth that accumulates through multiple generations in affluent communities to the west, the effects of living in East Austin’s impoverished neighborhoods have passed down in myriad direct and indirect ways.

  Growing up in a poor neighborhood can have a negative effect on everything from a child’s educational attainment, to their mental and physical health, to their choice of romantic partners, said Patrick Sharkey, a New York University sociologist.

  “In all these ways, growing up in a poor neighborhood affects all the different dimensions of our life as we grow up into adulthood,” Sharkey said. “And through all these ways it affects the next generation.”

  Nationally, two-thirds of African-Americans born between 1985 and 2000 now live in neighborhoods that are at least as impoverished as where their parents lived, according to Sharkey’s research. And many of the damaging effects of poverty are cumulative, he said, reinforcing over the years and generations.

  For example, mothers who grew up in middle-class environments had children who scored near the average on tests, even if they currently lived in poverty, he found. Mothers who grew up in poverty had children who scored two to four years of schooling behind the average, even if they currently lived in a middle-class environment now.

  “It’s not just how far apart the incomes of the rich and poor are,” Sharkey said, “it’s how it becomes manifest in the communities within a city.”

  There are exceptions like Rice-Gardner, of course, but they often prove the rule. Friendly Rice had the resources and the contacts to make sure his daughter went to the better schools in town—despite the discrimination she faced both on the way to school and once she got there.

  “It wasn’t if I was going to college, it was where,” she said. “It wasn’t if I was going to go to graduate school, it was where.”

  Her parents’ educational legacies live on through her. Rice-Gardner teaches at Austin Community College, where she can point to a poster of local African-American pioneers, whose illustrations gaze down from the entrance of the Eastview Campus’ African-American Cultural Center.

  “That’s daddy,” she tells a visitor, “at the top.”

  {{> slider page.sliderVonnye}}

  ###A divided status quo

  Seated in the cultural center, Rice-Gardner unrolled a poster-size chart of all the homeowners along her local stretch of East Seventh Street. As she scrolled through the poster, going through the decades from 1920 through today, the lines unveiled the ownership history for each property.

  Rice-Gardner paused over many of the names that have come and gone. Her first few tales evoked images of a close-knit African-American and immigrant community. But as the poster opened wider and time passed by, the stories turned to businesses, stores and restaurants that have overtaken the area.

  Only one other African-American resident remains on her block, the city’s black population having spread further east and north — and increasingly outside of the city limits altogether.

  Rice-Gardner’s parents paid $1,200 to buy their home. She said she now pays four- to five-times that amount each year for property taxes on the same house.

  “If I live another 20 years,” she said, “I will not be able to stay in my house.”

  For low-income homeowners, the tax collector makes it harder to stay in the city, putting pressure on Austin’s existing income segregation. And given the fact that the median income for the metro area’s African-American households is 40 percent lower than that of non-Hispanic white households, it puts pressure on Austin’s existing racial segregation, too.

  The widening income inequality also underscores an even deeper divide when it comes to wealth. In 2013, the median wealth in the country’s Anglo households was $141,900 — 13 times higher than the $11,000 median for African-American households, according to a Pew Research Center study.

  One of the biggest reasons for that wealth gap reaches back to lower rates of home ownership, said Signe-Mary McKernan, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Even aside from any potential increase in property value, McKernan said, simply paying a mortgage helps owners sock away money, sort of like an automatic savings account.

  “African-American and Hispanic families are not on the same wealth building path,” she said. “Wealth inequality is getting worse, not better.”

  While redlining and other overtly segregationist policies were outlawed in the 1960s and 1970s, the increasing wealth gaps suggest their elimination alone has not reversed the trends toward wider inequality.

  As the country moved out of the Civil Rights movement, through the disco 1970s and into the Reagan era, Austin did little to actively combat its divided status quo. The city’s housing and wealth divides barely budged, according to a 1979 report commissioned by the city’s Human Relations Commission.

  John Henneberger, the co-director of the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service and the recipient of a 2014 MacArthur Foundation “genius grant,” wrote that report. It was not flattering, and some of its more biting passages, including notes about the area’s developers and lenders, were edited out by the city manager.

  In an unedited version, he and his colleagues said they found no Census tract in the city “that can be considered truly integrated.”

  “One thing is clear,” they wrote, “the last decade has seen more legislation and changes in attitudes that promote housing integration than any other period. However, Austin remains a segregated city.”

  The separation—and in some cases, evidence suggesting outright discrimination—still exists today. Research following the subprime mortgage meltdown indicates that many lenders targeted minority populations with the riskier, higher-cost home loans.

  In particular, segregated clusters of minority neighborhoods made it easier and more efficient for lenders to target residents there, according to a new study led by Jackelyn Hwang, a Harvard sociology doctoral student.

  Austin didn’t see the same high rates of targeting as some other metro areas, Hwang said, but the metro area did have an unusually high level of subprime loans that went into very specific minority-heavy tracts.

  “Such unequal lending patterns will likely have long-term consequences for the accumulation of wealth for blacks and Hispanics that will last well beyond the housing crisis,” Hwang and her colleagues wrote.

  Yet even more benign and mundane public policy help sustain the wealth and housing gaps. Austin’s current zoning regulations prohibit many types of development that promote greater affordability, said Tretter, the UT lecturer, and private land-use plans for most newer developments are filled with restrictions that inhibit integration.

  “The people who are going to be displaced are those who are living in areas where there’s no private restrictions protecting them,” Tretter said. “That’s going to lead to more income segregation.”

  ### An Inertia Never Arrested

  Long before Henneberger decided to focus on projects in other Texas cities—his frustration with Austin had hit a boiling point—he immersed himself in the gentrification sweeping through Clarksville.

  When he started studying and working in the community as a UT undergraduate in 1975, only a couple Anglo residents lived there. A few hippies would swing by to drink whisky with “Uncle Seymour,” Henneberger said, but Clarksville still reflected its history as a post-Civil War freedmen’s community.

  The trickle of visitors eventually grew into a wave of people who saw the neighborhood as a funky, weird oasis in the city. They started displacing African-American families who’d rented homes in Clarksville for generations, and developers started to buy, rebuild and sell the homes.

  “All of a sudden,” Henneberger said, “a dynamic of real estate speculation and redevelopment was going on in Clarksville that just infuriated people because people were being displaced and property values were changing.”

  Henneberger and friends launched efforts to slow the gentrification. They painted anti-development yard signs. One church turned out in front of a developer’s home one Sunday morning, the choir singing and the pastor preaching out to whoever would hear.

  It didn’t work; Clarksville’s transformation is virtually complete today.

  “Now there’s a whole other generation which has absolutely no understanding of any of this,” Henneberger said, “except they kind of know that the handful of black homeowners who remain sort of snarl a little bit at people.”

  East Austin appears to be headed in the same general direction. A younger, wealthier, mostly Anglo population is moving in, often drawn by the diversity of the neighborhoods there. In many cases, they forge lasting relationships with the existing residents, but the economic disparities make the balance unstable at best, unsustainable at worst.

  “It’s always a matter of exploitation if the economic underlying basis of that relationship is so unequal, which it is,” Henneberger said.

  In an effort to sustain integration in these neighborhoods and encourage more of it elsewhere, the NAACP and the Texas Civil Rights Project filed a complaint with the city, arguing that local officials need to start addressing some of the Austin’s chronic housing oversights.

  The complaint claims Austin officials have not done enough to counteract the severe housing disparities of its past and its present. The city responded, noting the progress it made on several fronts over the years.

  The answers did not satisfy the NAACP or the civil rights project, which are currently considering their next moves, including a potential lawsuit against the city, said Brian McGiverin, an attorney for the project.

  “The studies that have really put Austin under a microscope have shown that the inertia that naturally resulted from de jure segregation was never really arrested,” he said.

  That historical inertia, combined today with rising pressure from higher property taxes, is forcing more and more low-income and African-American families to the suburbs and beyond. Rice-Gardner saw many of her friends and neighbors make the move to Pflugerville, where the black population has increased almost fivefold since 2000.

  As for her, though, she’ll stay in the neighborhood as long as she can. Few signs of the neighborhood’s “negro district” history remain today, and only a handful of her former neighbors still live there, but she has come to accept the neighborhood’s transformation—the city’s as well.

  Gentrification still concerns her. If property taxes keep rising, she might have to eventually sell the family house.

  “We have to embrace whatever comes our way,” she said. “You can’t hate. You can’t get mad. You have to understand the history of how things have changed, and you have to embrace it.”

  After all, she said, it’s still her neighborhood. It’s still her heritage. It’s still her home.
