If that doesn’t change, it could cost billions to the area’s economy - and allow poverty to continue its generational spread."

            <p>In its ruling, the court struck down segregationist zoning laws, so cities across the South started developing new policies to isolate minorities.</p>

            <h3>Evolution of a 'Negro District'</h3>            
            <p>In Austin, the strategy to isolate minorities took the form of the Koch and Fowler city plan, which in 1928 proposed the creation of a “Negro District” -- making it the only part of the city where African-Americans could access schools and other public services.</p>
            <p>Koch and Fowler also proposed that the district have the city’s weakest zoning restrictions, allowing the development of “a number of slightly objectionable industrial uses” -- essentially, any use that wasn’t specifically outlawed.</p>
