            <h3>Evolution of a ‘Negro District’</h3>            
            <p>In Austin, the strategy to isolate minorities came in the form of the Koch and Fowler city plan, which in 1928 proposed the creation of a “Negro District” &mdash; making it the only part of the city where African-Americans could access schools and other public services.</p>
            <p>Koch and Fowler also proposed that the district have the city’s weakest zoning restrictions, allowing the development of “a number of slightly objectionable industrial uses” &mdash; essentially, any use that wasn’t specifically outlawed.</p>

            <h3>Federal policy formalizes boundaries</h3>            
            <p>Less than a decade later, in 1935, the federal government launched a New Deal program that would reinforce segregationist boundaries in Austin and throughout the country. The program was designed to restore household wealth during the Great Depression, but it excluded most minority communities through redlining &mdash; the practice of denying or charging more for goods and services in certain neighborhoods, usually determined by race.</p>
            <p>Government-backed mortgages wouldn’t be offered in redlined districts, and virtually all the minority neighborhoods were redlined. In Austin, the largest redlined section encompassed Koch and Fowler’s “negro district.”</p>
            <p>Because the Home Owners Loan Corporation would not provide mortgages in those districts, most of the nation's African-American residents could not access one of the most significant efforts to buld household wealth in U.S. history.</p>
            <h4>Use the slider to see how the HOLC-designated “hazardous” areas &mdash; in which no federally backed mortgages were offered &mdash; compared with Austin’s black and Hispanic neighborhoods.</h4>

            <h3>Divided by I-35</h3>            
              <p>While the influx of Hispanics into Texas and Austin during the second half of the 20th century led to a much greater dispersal of their population throughout the area, the effects of those segregationist policies are still visible today. The vast majority of Austin’s African-American and Hispanic populations remain east of I-35.</p>
              <p>But Austin’s divisions run deeper than where its residents live. The policies that spawned a geographic divide set the stage for a sharp economic divide as well.</p>
              <p>Redlining not only blocked most minority residents from the country’s single-largest accumulation of household wealth, it also denied them the compound interest that future generations could derive from such affluence.</p>
              <p>Their exclusion from that wealth has calcified through an increasingly complex mix of social dynamics — subtle and unintentional forms of discrimination, disadvantaged schools, higher crime rates and passive public policies that maintain the status quo.</p>
              <p>Together, these forces divided Austin in the past and keep it divided today. The metro area has one of the highest rates of income segregation in the country, a factor that could ultimately limit the ability of Austin’s youth to climb the income ladder and bolster the region’s future prosperity.</p>
