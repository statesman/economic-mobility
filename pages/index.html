            <p>In Austin, the strategy to isolate minorities took the form of the Koch and Fowler city plan, which in 1928 proposed the creation of a “Negro District” &mdash; making it the only part of the city where African-Americans could access schools and other public services.</p>
            <p>Koch and Fowler also proposed that the district have the city’s weakest zoning restrictions, allowing the development of “a number of slightly objectionable industrial uses” &mdash; essentially, any use that wasn’t specifically outlawed.</p>

            <h3>Federal policy formalizes boundaries</h3>            
            <p>Less than a decade later, in 1935, the federal government launched a New Deal program that would reinforce segregationist boundaries in Austin and throughout the country. The program, designed to restore household wealth during the Great Depression, used redlining &mdash; the practice of denying goods or services to racially determined neighborhoods &mdash; to specifically exclude minority populations.</p>
            <p>Government-backed mortgages wouldn’t be offered in redlined districts, which were overwhelmingly populated by African-American and, to a lesser extent Hispanic, residents. In Austin, the largest redlined section encompassed Koch and Fowler’s black district.</p>
            <p>The Home Owners Loan Corporation would not provide mortgages for those districts, barring minorities from one of the country’s most significant efforts to build household wealth.</p>
            <h4>Use the slider to see how the HOLC-designated "hazardous" areas &mdash; in which no federally backed mortgages were offered &mdash; compare with areas with concentrations of black and Hispanic residents</h4>

            <h3>Divided by I-35</h3>            
              <p>While the influx of Hispanics into Texas and Austin during the second half of the 20th century led to a much greater dispersal of their population throughout the area, the largest concentrations remain in East Austin.</p>
              <p>We can still see the effects of those segregationist policies today, both in the city and around the metro area. The vast majority of Austin’s African-American and Hispanic populations remain east of I-35.</p>
              <p>But Austin’s divisions run deeper than where its residents live. The policies that spawned a geographic divide set the stage for a sharp economic divide as well.</p>
              <p>Redlining not only barred minorities from the country’s single-largest accumulation of household wealth, it also denied them the compound interest that future generations could derive from such affluence.</p>
              <p>Their exclusion from that wealth has calcified through an increasingly complex mix of social dynamics — subtle and unintentional forms of discrimination, disadvantaged schools, higher crime rates and passive public policies that maintain the status quo.</p>
              <p>Together, these forces divided Austin in the past and keep it divided today. The metro area has one of the highest rates of income segregation in the country, a factor that could ultimately limit the ability of many Austin youth to climb the income ladder and bolster the region’s future prosperity.</p>
